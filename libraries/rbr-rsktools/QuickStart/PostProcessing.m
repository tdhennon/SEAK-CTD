%% Introduction
% RSKtools includes a series of functions to post-process RBR logger
% data. Below we show how to implement some common processing steps to
% obtain the highest quality data possible.
%
% All post-processing functions are customisable with name-value pair
% input arguments.  Documentation for each function can be accessed
% using the Matlab commands |doc| and |help|.  For example, to open
% the help page for |RSKsmooth|, type: |doc RSKsmooth| at the Matlab
% command prompt.

% RSKtools Getting Started> for an introduction on how to load RBR
% data into Matlab from RSK files, make plots, and access the data.

%% Example processing sequence

% First, while in the RSKtools/QuickStart directory, open a connection
% to the RSK logger database file:
rsk = RSKopen('../sample.rsk');

% read the upcast from profiles 1 - 20
rsk = RSKreadprofiles(rsk, 'profile', 1:20, 'direction', 'up');

% plot a few profiles of temperature, conductivity, and chlorophyll
RSKplotprofiles(rsk,'profile',[1 10 20],...
    'channel',{'temperature','conductivity','chlorophyll'});


%% Derive sea pressure from total pressure
% We suggest deriving sea pressure first, especially when an
% atmospheric pressure other than the nominal value of 10.1325 dbar is
% desired.  Functions that require sea pressure, such as
% |RSKderivedepth|, will always use the nominal value if a custom
% value is not specified at this stage.  In this example we'll
% take atmospheric pressure to be 10 dbar.
rsk = RSKderiveseapressure(rsk,'patm',10);

% Keep a copy of the raw data to compare with the processed data.
raw = rsk;
raw = RSKderivesalinity(raw);


%% Correct for A2D zero-order hold
% The analog-to-digital (A2D) converter on RBR instruments must
% recalibrate periodically.  In the time it takes for the calibration
% to finish, one or more samples are missed.  The onboard firmware
% fills the missed scan with the same data measured during the
% previous scan, a technique called a zero-order hold.
%
% The function identifies zero-hold points by looking for where
% consecutive differences for each channel are equal to zero, and
% replaces these samples with a NaN or an interpolated value. See
% <https://docs.rbr-global.com/rsktools RSKtools on-line user manual>
% for further information.

rsk = RSKcorrecthold(rsk,'action','interp'); 


%% Low-pass filtering
% Low-pass filtering is commonly used to reduce noise and to match
% sensor time constants.  Applying a low pass filter to temperature
% and conductivity smooths high frequency variability and compensates
% for differences in sensor time constants.  Users may also wish to
% smooth other channels to reduce noise (e.g., optical channels such
% as chlorophyll).
%
% Most RBR instruments designed for profiling (branded as _|fast_) are
% equipped with thermistors that have a time constant of 100 msec,
% which is slower than the conductivity cell.  When the time constants
% are different, salinity will contain spikes at strong gradients.
% The solution is to "slow down" the conductivity sensor to match the
% thermistor.  In this example data set, the logger sampled at 6 Hz
% (found using |readsamplingperiod(rsk)|), so a 5 sample running
% average provides more than sufficient smoothing, and also reduces
% noise.
%
% Note: All functions that alter the data have an optional input
% called |'visualize'| that, when activated, plots data before and
% after applying the function.  Users specify which profile(s) to
% visualize.

rsk = RSKsmooth(rsk,'channel',{'temperature','conductivity'}, 'windowLength', 5);
rsk = RSKsmooth(rsk,'channel','chlorophyll', 'windowLength', 9, 'visualize', 10);


%% Alignment of conductivity and temperature 
% Conductivity, temperature, and pressure need to be aligned in time
% to account for the fact these sensors are not always co-located on
% the logger.  The implication is that, under dynamic conditions
% (e.g., profiling), the sensors are measuring a slightly different
% parcel of water at any instant.  
%
% Sensors with long time constants introduce a time lag to the data.
% Dissolved oxygen sensors often have a long time constant, and this
% can be fixed to some degree by shifting the data in time.
%
% When temperature and conductivity are misaligned, salinity will
% contain spikes at sharp interfaces and a bias in continuously
% stratified environments.  Properly aligning the sensors, together
% with matching the time response, will minimize salinity spiking and
% bias.
%
% In the case of RBR instruments, pressure is effectively an
% instantaneous measurement, and does not need to be lagged with
% respect to time.  The most important consideration is the relative
% timing of conductivity and temperature.  Therefore, in this example,
% we align conductivity to temperature by shifting conductivity in
% time.
%
% The classic approach to determine the optimal lag is to compute and
% plot salinity for a range of lags, and choose the lag (often by eye)
% with the smallest salinity spikes at sharp temperature interfaces.
% As an alternative approach, RSKtools includes a function called
% |RSKcalculateCTlag| that estimates the optimal lag between
% conductivity and temperature by minimizing salinity spiking. We
% currently suggest using both approaches to check for consistency.
% See the |RSKcalculateCTlag| help page for more information.  Typical
% lag values are 0, +1, or +2 samples for a 6 Hz instrument (about
% +0.2 sec).

lag = RSKcalculateCTlag(rsk);
rsk = RSKalignchannel(rsk,'channel','conductivity','lag',lag);


%% Remove loops
% Profiling in rough seas can cause the CTD profiling rate to vary,
% and even change sign (i.e., the CTD momentarily changes direction).
% When this happens, the CTD effectively samples its own wake,
% degrading the quality of the profile in regions of strong
% gradients. The measurements taken when the instrument is profiling
% too slowly or during a pressure reversal should not be used for
% further analysis. We recommend using |RSKremoveloops| to flag and
% treat the data when the instrument 1) falls below a threshold speed
% and 2) when the pressure reverses (the CTD "loops").  Before using
% |RSKremoveloops|, use |RSKderivedepth| to calculate depth from sea
% pressure, and then use |RSKderivevelocity| to calculate profiling
% rate.  
%
% In the example data set, good data is collected on the _upcast_.
% |RSKremoveloops|, when applied to this data, removes data when the
% instrument profiled slowly near the surface.

rsk = RSKderivedepth(rsk);
rsk = RSKderivevelocity(rsk);

% Apply the algorithm
rsk = RSKremoveloops(rsk,'threshold',0.3,'visualize',7);


%% Derive Practical Salinity
% RSKtools includes a convenience function to derive Practical
% Salinity using the TEOS-10 GSW function |gsw_SP_from_C|.  The
% TEOS-10 GSW Matlab toolbox is freely available from
% <http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm>.  The result is stored in the
% data table along with other measured and derived channels.
rsk = RSKderivesalinity(rsk);

%% Bin average all channels by sea pressure
% Bin averaging reduces sensor noise and ensures that each profile is
% referenced to a common grid. The latter is often an advantage for
% plotting data as "heatmaps."  |RSKbinaverage| allows users to bin
% channels according to any reference, but the most common choices are
% time, depth, and sea pressure.  It also can handle grids with a
% variable bin size.  In the following, the data are averaged into
% 0.25 dbar bins.
rsk = RSKbinaverage(rsk, 'binBy', 'Sea Pressure', 'binSize', 0.25, ...
                         'boundary', [0.5 5.5],'direction', 'up',...
                         'visualize', 10);
h = findobj(gcf,'type','line');
set(h(1:2:end),'marker','o','markerfacecolor','c')

%% Compare the raw and processed data
% Use |RSKplotprofiles| to compare the binned data to the raw data for
% a few example profiles.  Processed data are represented with thicker
% lines.
figure
channel = {'salinity','temperature','chlorophyll'};
profile  = [3 10 20];
h1 = RSKplotprofiles(raw,'profile',profile,'channel',channel);
h2 = RSKplotprofiles(rsk,'profile',profile,'channel',channel);
set(h2,'linewidth',3,'marker','o','markerfacecolor','w')
ax = findobj(gcf,'type','axes');
set(ax(1),'xlim',[-2 80])
set(ax(3),'xlim',[30 34])
set(ax,'ylim',[0 6.5])


%% Visualize data with a 2D plot
% |RSKimages| generates a time/depth heat-map of a channel. The x-axis
% is time; the y-axis is a reference channel (default is sea
% pressure).  All of the profiles must be evaluated on the same
% reference channel levels, which is accomplished with
% |RSKbinaverage|. The function supports customisable rendering to
% determine the length of gap shown on the plot. For more details, see
% <https://docs.rbr-global.com/rsktools RSKtools on-line user manual>

figure
RSKimages(rsk,'channel','chlorophyll','direction','up'); 


%% Add station data
% |RSKaddstationdata| appends station data to the profile data
% structure.  The allowable fields are: latitude, longitude, station,
% cruise, vessel, depth, date, weather, crew, comment and
% description. The function is vectorized, which allows multiple
% station data inputs for multiple profiles. When there is only one
% station data input specified for multiple profiles, all profiles 
% will be assigned with the same value.
%
% Station data is written into both the CSV and ODV file headers
% when the data is exported with |RSK2CSV| and |RSK2ODV|.

% apply the same station data to each profile
rsk = RSKaddstationdata(rsk,'latitude',45,'longitude',-25,...
                         'station',{'SK1'},'vessel',{'R/V RBR'},...
                         'cruise',{'Skootamatta Lake 1'});

% or use vectorized inputs
rsk = RSKaddstationdata(rsk,'profile',4:6,'station',{'S1','S2','S3'},...
                         'latitude',[45,44,46],...
                         'longitude',[-25,-24,-23],...
                         'comment','RSKtools demo');

%% 
% To view the station data in the 4th profile:
disp(rsk.data(4))


%% Export logger data to CSV files
% |RSK2CSV| writes logger data and metadata to one or more CSV files.
% The CSV files contain a header with important logger metadata,
% station metadata (if it exists), and a row of variable names and
% units above each column of channel data. If the data has been parsed
% into profiles, then one file will be written for each profile and an
% extra column called 'cast_direction' will be included.  The column
% will contain 'd' or 'u' to indicate whether the sample is part of
% the downcast or upcast, respectively. Users can select which
% channels and profiles are written, the output directory, and also
% specify comments to be placed after the metadata in the file header.
%
% |RSK2CSV(rsk,'channel',{'Conductivity','Pressure','Dissolved O2'},...
%              'profile', 1:3 ,'comment','Hey Jude');|
%
% RSKtools also has export functions to write Ocean Data View files,
% MAT files, and Ruskin RSK files.
